<h3>Hi there, this is Haolin Zhou.</h3>

<p align = "justify"> 
I am a geologist interested in biogeochemical cycling and the role of sedimentary rock life cycles in Earth’s surface system. My research focuses broadly on how interactions among rocks, fluids, and organic matter regulate the cycling of bioactive elements such as <strong>C</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, and <strong>O</strong> over geological timescales. The methods I usually employ include fieldwork, experiments, laboratory analysis, and modeling.

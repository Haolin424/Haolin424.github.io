<h1>Welcome</h1>

<h3>Hi there, this is Haolin Zhou.</h3>

<p align = "justify"> 
I am a geologist interested in biogeochemical cycling and the role of sedimentary rock life cycles in Earth’s surface system. My research focuses broadly on how interactions among rocks, fluids, and organic matter regulate the cycling of bioactive elements such as <strong>C</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, and <strong>O</strong> over geological timescales. The methods I usually employ include fieldwork, experiments, laboratory analysis, and modeling.

I am currently a <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/geology-geophysics/updates/michel-t-halbouty-30-postdoctoral-fellow-in-geology-and-geophysics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michel T. Halbouty ’30</a> postdoctoral fellow at Texas A&M Univserity, where I mainly collaborate with <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/geology-geophysics/contact/profiles/lucien-nana-yobo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucien Nana Yobo</a>. Piror to TAMU, I received a PhD in Earth Science from Rice University under the supervision of <a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/mark-torres" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Torres</a> in 2025. I received a MSc in Earth Science from University of Alberta under the supervision of <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/nharris" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicholas Harris</a> in 2020. I graduated from China University of Petroleum - Beijing in 2017 with a degree in Geological Engineering.

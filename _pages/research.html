The life cycle of sedimentary rocks is closely related to Earth's surface processes and biogeochemical cycling. 
Over geologic timescales, the formation and breakdown of sedimentary rocks can regulate atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>
levels, influencing planetary habitability. My research integrates microanalytical and bulk-rock approaches to examine 
how sedimentary rock (particularly <strong>organic carbon-bearing mudstone</strong>) geochemistry evolves during deposition, 
burial (and diagenesis), and weathering.

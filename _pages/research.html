The life cycle of sedimentary rocks is closely related to Earth's surface processes and biogeochemical cycling. 
Over geologic timescales, the formation and breakdown of sedimentary rocks can regulate atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>
levels, influencing planetary habitability. My research integrates microanalytical and bulk-rock approaches to examine 
how sedimentary rock (particularly <strong>organic carbon-bearing mudstone</strong>) geochemistry evolves during deposition, 
burial (and diagenesis), and weathering.

    During deposition, sediment, the precursor of mudstone, can store organic carbon (OC) from terrestrial and marine inputs. 
    In order to explore the primary controls on OC accumulation during deposition, along drilled cores 
    of the Middle and Upper Devonian Horn River Formation (mudstone), I use benchtop XRF to analyze major elemental concentrations 
    at mm-scale resolution, complemented by bulk-rock geochemical analyses using ICP-MS at the meter scale. 
    These data show that redox conditions, sedimentation, and bioproductivity exert varying controls on OC burial across stratigraphic intervals. 
    Importantly, the inferred primary controls on OC accumulation depend on the spatial scale of analysis and on whether a stratigraphic framework is applied.

    Redox conditions are a key control on OC preservation during deposition and are commonly reconstructed using redox-sensitive trace elements 
    such as molybdenum (Mo). Mo is preferentially enriched under euxinic conditions, but Mo accumulation is also influenced by factors 
    like mineral hosts, Mo availability in the water column, and early diagenetic processes, complicating paleoredox interpretations 
    based on bulk-rock Mo concentrations alone.
    </p>
    <p>
    To better constrain the mechanisms controlling Mo accumulation, I combine bulk-rock Mo concentrations (ICP-MS) with mineral-specific, 
    micro-scale Mo distributions (EPMA) in an end-member mixing framework. This allows the relative contributions 
    of redox conditions, mineralogy, and diagenesis to be quantified across mudstones from a wide range of depositional settings and geological ages, 
    improving reconstructions of depositional redox conditions and interpretations of OC preservation.
